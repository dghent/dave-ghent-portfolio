					<h1>Strava</h1>
					<p>Strava is a social platform for fitness and activity tracking, offering a subscription with premium tools to help cyclists, runners, and swimmers train for races and enhance their performance. I joined as a design lead to work on premium features for performance tracking. I redesigned the paid experience and launched several mobile and web-based performance training tools within the subscription bundle.</p>

				<h2>Shipped designs</h2>
				<p>I created a dedicated Summit tab as the new home for paid training features, where Strava users can easily view their activity summaries and track performance improvements over time.</p>

				<h2>Process</h2>
				<p>I conducted several studies to define a new persona: the high-performing athlete. I regularly explored how athletes used Strava to meet their unique training needs.</p>

				<h2>Impact</h2>
				<p>“Summit” was live as part of the paid bundle with a go to market strategy as the leading feature set. Shortly after we launched, Strava generated $275 million in revenue in 2023, a 25% increase on the previous year.</p>
